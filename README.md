# Lending_Case_Study

## Objectives
The objective of this case study is to mitigate credit loss by effectively identifying high-risk loan applicants. By employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the study seeks to discern key factors influencing loan default. Through this process, the company aims to pinpoint robust indicators of default, thus enabling more precise risk assessment and proactive mitigation strategies. By understanding the underlying drivers of default, the company can streamline its lending practices, minimize exposure to risky borrowers, and ultimately reduce the volume of defaulted loans. This proactive approach not only safeguards the company's financial stability but also enhances its ability to make informed lending decisions.
